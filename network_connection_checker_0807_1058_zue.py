Network Connection Checker
# NOTE: 重要实现细节
========================
# NOTE: 重要实现细节

This module provides a function to check the network connection status by
attempting to connect to a specified URL. It uses the requests library
to make web requests and the socket library for low-level network
connection checks.

Attributes:
    None

Methods:
    check_connection(url): Checks the network connection status by attempting to access a given URL.

def check_connection(url, timeout=5):
    """
    Checks the network connection status by attempting to access a given URL.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL to check the connectivity.
        timeout (int): The timeout in seconds for the request. Defaults to 5.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the connection is successful, False otherwise.

    Raises:
        requests.exceptions.RequestException: If a request-related error occurs.
        socket.error: If a socket-related error occurs.
