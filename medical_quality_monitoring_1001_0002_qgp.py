Medical Quality Monitoring Program
This program is designed to monitor medical quality by analyzing patient records.
It calculates various quality metrics such as average wait time, patient satisfaction,
and error rates.

Attributes:
    None

Methods:
    calculate_average_wait_time: Calculates the average wait time for patients.
    calculate_patient_satisfaction: Calculates the average patient satisfaction.
    calculate_error_rate: Calculates the average error rate.
