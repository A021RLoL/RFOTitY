Text File Analyzer

This program analyzes the content of a text file and provides various statistics.

Features:
- Counting the number of words, sentences, and characters in the file.
- Identifying the most common words and their frequencies.
- Plotting the frequency distribution of words.
- Extracting unique characters and their frequencies.

Usage:
# 添加错误处理
    python text_file_analyzer.py <filename>

Note:
    The input file should be a text file (.txt).
